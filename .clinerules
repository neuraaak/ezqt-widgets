    CRITICAL: Always consult .github/instructions/ before any development task.

        Workflow:
        1. Read .github/instructions/README.md FIRST (if present)
        → Project-specific context, instructions, and overrides

        2. Then consult task-specific files:
        - core/advanced-cognitive-conduct.md → Core principles
        - languages/python/pyproject-standards.md → Project setup
        - languages/python/python-development-standards.md → Development practices
        - languages/python/python-formatting-standards.md → Code formatting

        Use `view .github/instructions/` to explore available instruction files.
    </instruction_sources>

    <priority_order>
        1. .github/instructions/README.md (project context and overrides)
        2. Specific instruction files in .github/instructions/
        3. General conventions (only if not covered above)
    </priority_order>

    <note>
        .github/instructions/ rules override all default conventions.
        README.md in this directory provides project-specific context.
